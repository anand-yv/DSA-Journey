## DSA PATH

I am currently using the [Strivers A2Z DSA CourseSheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/) to learn and master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). To showcase my progress and dedication to improving my coding skills

I have created a section in my GitHub readme file dedicated to the topics I have completed from the sheet.

As I complete each topic, I plan to update the list to demonstrate my progress in mastering DSA concepts. So far, I have completed the following topics from the Striver A2Z DSA Sheet:

<details>
  <summary>1. Learn the Basics</summary>
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>1.2 <a href="https://github.com/anand-yv/DSA-Journey/tree/master/Patterns">Patterns</a> </li>
  <ul>
</details>


<!-- Each of these topics has been covered in a step-by-step manner in the Striver A2Z DSA Sheet, and I have gained a thorough understanding of the concepts by practicing coding problems and solutions provided in the sheet. -->

<!-- I believe that learning DSA is crucial for any aspiring programmer or computer science enthusiast, and using the Striver A2Z DSA Sheet has been an excellent resource to help me achieve my goals. By showcasing my progress in my GitHub readme file, I hope to demonstrate my proficiency in DSA concepts and showcase my dedication to improving my coding skills. -->
